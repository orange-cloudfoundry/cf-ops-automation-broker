Maintenance info https://github.com/orange-cloudfoundry/cf-ops-automation-broker/issues/278

## Design

Initial step to focus on maintenance_info support (refreshing osb-client view including dashboard) with coab-vars.yml update.

Stemcell/bosh-release/deployment model upgrades are currently out of scope of COAB broker, and rather handled by coa pipelines.

This work might benefit for plan update and params update.

Update endpoint triggers writing of 
* coab-vars.yml: flat variables used in bosh deployment
* coab-fingerprint.yml: single fingerprint variable used to track completion of the deployment update in the resulting manifest

coab-fingerprint.yml is inserted by deployment models into the bosh manifest as an extra unrecognized attribute (which gets ignored by bosh director). Being a single yaml key makes it easy to be managed by a bosh operator regardless of the key value.

Currently getLastOperation is not fetching the paas-templates repo (as an optimization). Can we avoid fetching it ?
- propagate the deployment completion fingerprint in the operation field
   - currently includes the OSB provision endpoint JSON body (used to propagate the request to the nested inner broker) => prefix it with "osb-request"
   - add `coab-fingerprint` key with coab-vars.yml as content
      - Q: would this leak confidential information to the OSB client ? 
         - OSB client is rather trusted (OSB-CMDB)
         - coab-vars.yml is just the same data formatted differently.
      - Q: what about optimizing space to not reach max size of the OSB `state` param ?
         - coab-vars.yml is 1000 chars long without custom params 
         - comparison hash needs to be generated from normalized formatting of the two yaml structure: CoabVarsDto POJO
         - alternative hashes
            - java hashCode on CoabVarsDto
            - more complex MD5 ?
         - => include hashCode on CoabVarsDto of the coab-vars into the state parameter and only compare the two hascodes
         - we keep the full coab-vars.yml into the manifest to ease troubleshooting and auditing in paas-templates git repo  

--- status
* [x] check coab-noop proto with fingerprint
   * [x] find a way to assert this into the deployment models
   * [x] refine coab noop model with realistic coab-vars.yml (including -- doc separator)
      * [ ] test that the prepare script also works if --- doc separator is missing ??
   * [ ] verify coab-noop smoke test is still green with coab-vars.yml generated by coab
      * [ ] need to rebase noop service instance branch against feature-coab-v49-3 + reset
   * [ ] apply to all other models
* [x] inject completion marker hashcode  into last operation state
   * [x] inject coabvars to PipelineCompletionTracker.getPipelineOperationStateAsJson()
      * coabvars missing in the case of delete
         * (delete is optionally skipped and not forwarded to inner broker)
         * provide null coab-vars reference for delete: won't be checked for completion anyway
   * [ ] deserialize coab-vars from deployment manifest
      * Pb: coab-vars contains arbitrary nested content (from params) and so does not suit plain deserialization using Gson unless type
      * Use Jackson instead of Gson
      * [x] Add equals/hashcode/toString to CoabVarsDto
      * [x] Add parsing code into VarsFilesYmlFormatter
         * [ ] consider renaming to reflect also parsing
      * [x] Add test coverage for osb-cmdb sample inputs in VarsFilesYmlFormatterTest
         * [ ] Refactor method names to surface parsing
      * [x] add parsing to SecretsGenerator contract
         * [x] Introduce New DTO to parse the generated manifest, only picking up CoabVarsDTO: BoshDeploymentManifestDTO
            * [x] Add unit test for parsing sample manifests 
         * [x] Add test coverage
         * [ ] Consider refactoring into SecretsManager to surface parsing role
      * [x] adapt PipelineCompletionTracker to deserialize using SecretsGenerator
         * [x] Add test coverage 
* [ ] Refine BoshServiceProvisionningTest
   * [ ] Adapt generated manifest to include completion marker
      * Need to capture CoabVarsDto or parse it from disk to include it as a completion marker in the manifest (Possibly through BoshDeploymentManifestDTO)
   * [ ] Add test of plan upgrade
   * [ ] Add test of maintenance_info upgrade ?
   

## Detailed tasks


* [x] check bump of sc-osb. Coab is running 2.1.2.RELEASE. 
   * Maintenance_info support requires 3.1.2.RELEASE or 3.2.0-M1
   * Bump to 3.1.x or 3.2.x may imply boot and spring bumps (see [version-compatibility](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-open-service-broker#version-compatibility))])
   
Spring Cloud Open Service Broker | Open Service Broker API | Spring Boot | Spring Framework
-- | -- | -- | --
3.2.x | 2.15 | 2.3.x | 5.2.x
3.1.x | 2.15 | 2.2.x | 5.2.x
3.0.x | 2.14 | 2.1.x | 5.1.x
2.1.x | 2.14 | 2.0.x | 5.0.x
   * Currently COA is running:
      * SpringCloud dependencies Hoxton.SR8. Hoxton.SR8 is compatible with Spring Boot 2.3.x and 2.2.x. See https://spring.io/blog/2020/08/28/spring-cloud-hoxton-sr8-has-been-released
      * SpringBoot 2.3.3
      * Spring 5.2.8.RELEASE
   * SC-OSB bump requires using reactive apis, but we remain with servlet blocking stack. See https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-open-service-broker/commit/121291aeec0f565bc0202d5c1d85c2eb27becbea      
 
* [x] check catalog can be configured to return maintenance info: test noop
* [ ] design end-to-end test of service instance upgrade with noop (to simulate old service instance without x-osb-cmdb)
   * [x] configure noop 49.0.0 without dashboard url 
   * [x] create one noop instance `reference-0` without x-osb-cmdb params. Expect no dashboard url
   * [x] configure noop 49.0.1 with dashboard url with v1 using backing service instance guid. 
   * [x] check  noop instance `reference-0` is upgradeable
   * [ ] create one noop instance `reference` without x-osb-cmdb params. Expect dashboard url with v1 using service instance guid
   * [ ] configure noop maintenance_info V2
   * [ ] configure noop dashboard url with v2 using brokered guid
   * [x] test that CF CC accepts `cf update-service --upgrade reference -c params.json`
       * [x] coab implements service instance update support
       * [ ] coab generates new `coab-fingerprint.yml` + coab-vars.yml
          * [x] generify existing coab-vars provisionning code to also apply on update
          * [x] adapt git processor to support pre and post update OSB life cycle hooks 
          * [ ] adapt provisionning code in BoshProcessor+ BoshProcessorTest to support update
             * [x] adapt create logic to update. Always respond with update in progress for now + dashboard url
             * [ ] update coab-vars generation to also generate fingerprint
             
             * [ ] adapt getlastoperation logic to check match of `coab-fingerprint.yml`
             * [ ] refactor to reduce duplication between create and update
       * [ ] Optimize response time for noop updates 
          * if changes were applied to coab-vars.yml w.r.t.
             *  git commit & git push
             *  coa pipeline triggers, potentially deploying grafana with FQDN matching brokered guid.    
             *  manifest gets committed with `coab-fingerprint`
          * [ ] if no changes will be applied to coab-vars.yml, responds with update completed + dashboard url    
   * [ ] assert coab-vars.yml now contains x-osb-cmdb   
   * [ ] assert update completes once bosh deployment completes   
   * [ ] assert `reference` service instance now returns dashboard url with v2 using brokered guid   
* [ ] Implement OSB service instance update which synchronously
* [ ] Store maintenance_info in coab-vars.yml

Q: would this conflict with service instance upgrade pipeline ?
A: should not, since only coab-vars.yml would change

Q: is it a good idea to simplify this upgrade to not trigger coab-vars.yml change nor deployment update ?
   * would imply a mix of dashboard urls with brokered guid and backing guids
   
## Details   
   
  * [x] test that CF CC accepts `cf update-service --upgrade reference -c params.json`
      * CF CLI rejects it:
      * Tested it with direct CC API: `CF_TRACE=true cf curl -X PUT /v2/service_instances/39308492-68d3-4601-adb6-8f76f37392f5?accepts_incomplete=true -d @/tmp/maintenance_info.json`
```json
{
  "maintenance_info": {
    "description": "Dashboard url with backing service guids",
    "version": "49.0.1"
  },
  "parameters": {
