Pb: GONE response status is always mapped to 500 errors, even when wrapped into our exception mechanism
* root cause is sc-osb lib mapping unknown exceptions to 500 including spring ResponseStatusException. 
   * Alternative fixes
     * [ ] map to sc-osb named exceptions: 
       * pb: would display possibly misleading exception names to coab operators, e.g. 422 would be mapped to ServiceInstanceBindingDoesNotExistException
       * pb: would display misleading user exception messages to osb client platform users 
         * [ ] with distinct exception depending on the current operation: provision vs bind ...
     * [ ] Contribute programmatic error status support in sc-osb
     * [ ] Override ServiceBrokerWebMvcExceptionHandler with a custom bean with higher precedence 
* additionally, sc-osb has no direct 410 gone exception, instead different exception is required for different operation, see https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-open-service-broker/issues/279 and https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-open-service-broker/commit/b7b739da0a276213d4ce444cc026831abc173242

Pb: the response code and message mapping is using spring4 annotation based mechanism and therefore handling individually each status code

Use of ResponseStatusException requires integration testing to make sure Spring does not swallow the configured user-facing broker error message

```
Changes to the Default Error Pageâ€™s Content

The error message and any binding errors are no longer included in the default error page by default. This reduces the risk of leaking information to a client. server.error.include-message and server.error.include-binding-errors can be used to control the inclusion of the message and binding errors respectively. Supported values are always, on-param, and never.

How to test it ?
* [ ] Add a test case in BoshServiceProvisionningTest with a wiremock binding response returning 400 Bad request status with an associated message
