Pb: GONE response status is always mapped to 500 errors, even when wrapped into our exception mechanism
* one cause is ourselves wrapping as ServiceBrokerException which gets mapped to 500 errors.
* second cause is sc-osb missing support for programmatic status code return (only support named exceptions)
* third cause is sc-osb lib mapping unknown exceptions to 500 including spring5 ResponseStatusException designed for .
* Alternative fixes
  * [ ] map to sc-osb named exceptions: 
    * pb: would display possibly misleading exception names to coab operators, e.g. 422 would be mapped to ServiceInstanceBindingDoesNotExistException
    * pb: would display misleading user exception messages to osb client platform users 
      * [ ] with distinct exception depending on the current operation: provision vs bind ...
  * [ ] Contribute programmatic error status support in sc-osb
  * [x] Override ServiceBrokerWebMvcExceptionHandler with a custom bean with higher precedence
     * See https://www.baeldung.com/exception-handling-for-rest-with-spring#controlleradvice
     * This also addresses default spring leak prevention mechanism. See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62459836/exception-message-not-included-in-response-when-throwing-responsestatusexception and https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-2.3-Release-Notes#changes-to-the-default-error-pages-content 
```
Changes to the Default Error Pageâ€™s Content

The error message and any binding errors are no longer included in the default error page by default. This reduces the risk of leaking information to a client. server.error.include-message and server.error.include-binding-errors can be used to control the inclusion of the message and binding errors respectively. Supported values are always, on-param, and never.

How to test it ?
* [x] Add a test case in BoshServiceProvisionningTest with a wiremock binding response returning 400 Bad request status with an associated message
