This directory contains mocks for the BoshServiceProvisionningTest that
provide hermetic nested service broker responses.

The catalog and the service instance / binding requests need to be consistent
in terms of service definition id and service plan id.


These Ids are independent from those served by the BoshBrokerApplication (COAB) which applies id mappings.
